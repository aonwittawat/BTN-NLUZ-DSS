    <!-- SECTION NLUZ ZONES -->
    <section class="p-4 p-md-4 text-body-secondary">
      <h1>Thematic Layers / Zones</h1>
      <p>The major thematic layers viz. 9 macro zones; 23 micro zones and 23 nano zones; relevant Right of Ways (RoW) or
        buffers; LULC; and demography components have been considered for technical definitions as enlisted in the
        following:</p>
      <h4>Nine Macro, Twenty Three Micro and Twenty Three Nano Land Use Zones </h4>
    
    
      <h2>Macro Zone 1: Agricultural Land</h2>
      <p>Agricultural land refers to land devoted to crop production and livestock rearing to produce food, fiber and fuel
        for human sustenance (DAO, 2023). It consists of four micro land use zones as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 1.1. Kamzhing:</strong> Means agricultural land (with or without bench terraced) which can be
          used for multiple agricultural purposes including dryland cropping (cereal crops, vegetables, MAPS), establishment
          of orchards, plantation crops and improved pasture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 1.2. Protected Chhuzhing:</strong> Means irrigated and bench terraced agricultural land that
          are demarcated and mapped out in clusters to be protected and used for paddy cultivation only to ensure at least
          35% rice self-sufficiency for all times to come. Protected chhuzhing will not be allowed for conversion or other
          agricultural use (DoA, 2023).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 1.3. Regulated Chhuzhing:</strong> Means irrigated and bench terraced agricultural land that
          are outside of Protected Chhuzhing, which can be used for paddy production (if owners are interested) and other
          agricultural purposes as in Kamzhing (DoA, 2023).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 1.4. Agricultural Leased Land:</strong> Refers to productive state land leased for commercial
          agriculture and livestock farming for a defined period of time with a right to use land but no ownership of land
          (DoA, 2023).
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Macro Zone 2: Rural Settlement</h2>
      <p>Refers to settlement other than defined/ demarcated urban settlements, which includes residential and institutional
        land used for dwellings or some form of rural habitations in clusters or scattered setups. It is also defined as
        settlement for displaced populations settled on land outside of cities and towns and the population is often
        dependent on agricultural and pastoral practices and has fewer community infrastructure systems than in urban
        settlements (UNHRC, 2020).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 2.1. Residential Land:</strong> Means a registered land for dwelling house both in
          Thromde/urban and rural areas (Land Act, 2007).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 2.2. Institutional Land:</strong> Means the registered land for office complexes, research
          stations, academic, medical, and religious establishments (Land Act, 2007). Institutional land use within Thromde
          boundary is classified under the urban zone.
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Macro Zone 3: Sustainable Forest Management Area (SFMA)</h2>
      <p>Refers to a designated area or region of the forests where the management practices and activities are carried out
        in a manner that ensures the long-term health and productivity of the forest ecosystem while meeting the social,
        economic, ecological, and cultural needs of present and future generations. Sustainable forest management involves
        balancing the utilization of forest resources with the conservation and protection of forests, ecosystems,
        biodiversity, and other environmental values. It includes scientific management areas such as FMU, working scheme,
        CF and Local Forest Management (Forest and Nature Conservation Code of Best Management Practices of Bhutan, Vol I &
        III).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 3.1. Forest Management Unit (FMU):</strong> Means an area of State Reserved Forest Land
          designated for scientific management of forest (FNCA, 2023).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 3.2. Community Forests (CF):</strong> Means any area of State Reserved Forest Land designated
          for management by a local community (FNCA, 2023).
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Macro Zone 4: Nature Conservation Area (NCA)</h2>
      <p>Means any designated area that is primarily established for the conservation and protection of natural ecosystems,
        biodiversity, and ecological processes to safeguard unique or sensitive habitats, endangered species, or areas of
        high ecological value. It includes areas declared to be a National Park, Wildlife Reserve, Nature Reserve, Protected
        Forest, Biosphere Reserve, Critical Watershed, Biological Corridor or any other area meriting protection. The
        primary focus in these areas is the preservation of natural resources, including flora, fauna, landscapes, and
        natural features, while restricting or regulating human activities that may harm or disrupt the ecosystems (FNCRR,
        2017).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 4.1. Protected Area (PA):</strong> Means an area, which has been declared to be a National
          Park, Wildlife Reserve, Nature Reserve, Protected Forest, Biosphere Reserve, Nature Reserve, Strict Nature
          Reserve, Critical Watershed, Biological Corridor, or any other area meriting protection (FNCA, 2023).
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Nano Zone 4.1.1. National Park:</strong> Means large natural or near natural areas set aside to
              protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic
              of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual,
              scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities (Forest & Nature Conservation Code, 2021).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nano Zone 4.1.2. Wildlife Sanctuary:</strong> Is an area where animal habitats and their surroundings
              are protected from any sort of disturbance (Forest & Nature Conservation Rules & Regulations, 2017).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nano Zone 4.1.3. Strict Nature Reserve:</strong> Means protected areas that are strictly set aside to
              protect biodiversity and possibly geological/ geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and
              impacts are strictly controlled and limited to ensure protection of the conservation values. Such protected
              areas can serve as indispensable reference areas for scientific research and monitoring (Forest & Nature
              Conservation Code, 2021).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nano Zone 4.1.4. Biological Corridor:</strong> Means an area set aside to connect one or more
              Protected Areas (Forest & Nature Conservation Rules & Regulations, 2017).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nano Zone 4.1.5. Botanical Park:</strong> Are those areas that are preserved and maintained for
              in-situ conservation of floral diversities.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro Zone 4.2. Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECM):</strong> Are areas achieving the
          long-term and effective in-situ conservation of biodiversity outside of protected areas (IUCN).
          <ul>
            <li>

            <h2>Macro Zone 7: Urban</h2>
            <p>The Local Government Act of Bhutan 2014 designates urban areas as Dzongkhag and Dzongkhag Yenlag Thromde. However, urban zones within the context of this edition are defined based on approved boundaries, which initially originated from the 2010 limits but have been expanded or adjusted over time. The boundaries are determined by the Department of Human Settlements (DHS), considering relevant factors such as urban growth, adoption of new planning boundaries, and conversion of rural land to urban precincts. These boundaries are not limited to a specific year but encompass various versions implemented on the ground. Under NLUZ, all micro zones and land uses within the urban zones are classified as urban, regardless of their development status. The management of micro zones is facilitated through a structural plan developed and implemented by the DHS. These areas, no longer included in the rural land database maintained by NLCS, undergo land pooling or reconfiguration to ensure planned and guided development. It is important to note that while some urban areas may not be fully developed, their land is maintained in an urban registry to accommodate future growth and development. The hybrid approach to urban zones in NLUZ considers multiple boundary versions and relies on the implementation of a structural plan to guide land use and promote sustainable urban development.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Macro Zone 8: Rangeland</h2>
            <p>Rangelands in Bhutan are synonymous with the term “Tsamdro”, which basically means grazing land for livestock and wild ungulates (DoL, 2017). As per Land Act 2007, “Tsamdro” means the Government Reserved Forests land leased out (TUT) for grazing and improved pasture management as land use on the ground. The rangelands in Bhutan extend from subtropical zones in the south to the alpine zones in the northern parts of the country. The subtropical and temperate rangelands are found at elevations ranging from 150 to 3600 metres asl and the alpine meadows are found at an elevation range of 3600 – 5000 metres asl. However, in future editions, Rangeland shall subsume alpine shrubs, meadows, moraines, shrubs, snow and glaciers as well for inclusive land use and land cover management purposes, in concurrence with the Royal Command conveyed on 19th October 2017 towards achieving the four broad objectives of EPIC (Environmental conservation; Preserving & promoting culture; Integrity of territorial security and independence; and Conserving environment).</p>
            <p>There are about 20 multi-sectoral agencies who are directly or indirectly involved in some activities in the rangelands, mostly in a piece-meal uncoordinated manner and in silos. These activities include, for NLCS to carry out Tsamdro survey and mapping; DoL’s program support to herders and livestock; DoFPS’s administration and management of forests flora and fauna; NBC’s biodiversity initiatives; DAMC’s support to the Bhutan Yak Federation and Yak Cooperatives; DoW and NCHM initiatives in managing wetlands and cryospheres; DoT’s eco-tourism initiatives; RBA’s border surveillance; DoE’s electrification/energy supports; and other allied agencies in diverse extant and nature of supports. While the uncoordinated initiatives by different agencies are done with the best of intentions, they do not help weave an overall fabric that is sustainable and beneficial to the country in the long run.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, the number of yak herders are in decline, young highlanders migrate to urban areas, grazing grounds are getting depleted and there are no signs of progressive improvement in the livelihood of the highlanders. For example, of the about 12,000 highland households in the 11 highland Dzongkhags, only 1,053 households own and herd yaks. Therefore, there is a compelling need for all the players to collaborate and co-create values through a well-coordinated effort. This recognition of Rangelands as a major land use is an attempt to bring all stakeholders onboard, towards harnessing the hidden potentials of Rangelands and Tsamdros for the larger national interests.</p>
